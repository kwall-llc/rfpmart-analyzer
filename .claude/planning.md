# Planning Mode Configuration

## Thinking Triggers
- Use "think" for RFP analysis algorithm development planning
- Use "think harder" for React component architecture decisions  
- Use "ultrathink" for system-wide refactoring or security audits

## Domain-Specific Planning

### Frontend Development
1. **Component Architecture**: React/TypeScript patterns and structure
2. **State Management**: Context API or state library integration
3. **Performance**: Bundle size and loading optimization
4. **User Experience**: RFP analysis workflow optimization

### Data Processing Development  
1. **RFP Parsing**: Document structure analysis and extraction
2. **Analysis Algorithms**: Scoring and comparison methodologies
3. **Data Storage**: Efficient data structures and caching
4. **Integration**: API design for data flow

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Component and utility function testing
2. **Integration Testing**: Data flow and API testing
3. **E2E Testing**: Complete RFP analysis workflows
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with large RFP datasets

## Planning Workflows

### Feature Development
```
1. ultrathink → Comprehensive feature analysis
2. Plan architecture with frontend-specialist agent
3. Plan data processing with data-analyst agent  
4. Plan testing with testing-specialist agent
5. Implement with checkpoints
6. Validate with /test
```

### Bug Fixes
```
1. think → Root cause analysis
2. Plan fix with appropriate agent
3. Implement with checkpoint
4. Test with real data
5. Deploy with /build
```

### Performance Optimization
```
1. think harder → Performance bottleneck analysis
2. /analyze-performance → Detailed analysis
3. Plan optimizations with performance-analyzer agent
4. Implement with checkpoints
5. Validate improvements
```

### Security Review
```
1. ultrathink → Security threat analysis
2. /audit-security → Comprehensive security audit
3. Plan improvements with security-auditor agent
4. Implement security enhancements
5. Validate security posture
